# Building with Google Maps API

Part 2 - First, I created one marker to display on the map. Once I had one marker displayed, I created an array of objects with multiple restaurant locations, which I iterated through each restaurant's latitude and longitude to create a marker for each. Finally, I added some styles to the map that I found on the Google Maps API documentation. These styles gave the map a dark mode style.
