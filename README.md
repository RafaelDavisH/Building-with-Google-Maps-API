Beginners Series on Building with Google Maps API. Starting with a simple load of Google Map using latitude and longitude to center the map, and the API Key. The series will consist of several videos taking a simple map with a marker for one restaurant to dark mode map with multiple restaurant locations served through a Contentful API, a sidebar listing all restaurants by name, including a dynamic search input on top, and each marker when click would display a modal with the restaurant's address, photos, other important information. Each restaurants information will be served with Foursquare Places API and/or Google Places API.
